Title: Min Heap Implementation Using Single Linked List

Description:
This project is an implementation of a min heap data structure using a single linked list in C++. A min heap is a binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.

In this implementation, we utilize a single linked list to represent the structure of the heap. Each node of the linked list contains a value and a pointer to the next node. The heap property is maintained by performing necessary operations on the linked list, such as insertion, deletion, and heapify.

The project provides a set of functions to perform various operations on the min heap, including inserting a new element, deleting the minimum element, checking if the heap is empty, and displaying the contents of the heap.

By using a linked list to implement the min heap, this project offers a dynamic and flexible data structure that can efficiently handle the operations associated with heaps. It provides a clear and concise implementation that can serve as a useful reference for understanding the inner workings of a min heap and linked list-based data structures in general.

Whether you're a beginner learning about heaps or an experienced programmer looking for an implementation reference, this project can be a valuable resource. Feel free to explore the code, understand the logic behind the operations, and adapt it to suit your specific requirements.
